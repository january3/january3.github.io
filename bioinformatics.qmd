Some of my bioinformatics projects.

 * [tmod](https://tmod.online) â€“ an R package for gene set enrichment
   analysis. It implements a novel method for gene set enrichment
   analysis which beats other in terms of biological reproducibility
   ([Zyla et al. and Weiner, 2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz823)).
